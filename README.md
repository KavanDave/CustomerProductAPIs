**RESTful API for Customer and Product Data Management**
This project features a set of RESTful APIs designed for managing customer and product data. It implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for both customer and product records within a database.

Utilizing ADO.NET, the APIs leverage inline SQL queries to ensure efficient data manipulation while minimizing code redundancy. This approach enhances maintainability and readability, making it easier to manage and extend the API as needed.

**Key Features:**

_Comprehensive CRUD operations for customers and products_

_Efficient database interactions using ADO.NET_

_Inline SQL queries to reduce code duplication_

_Emphasis on maintainability and scalability__
